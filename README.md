## Important

### Point

* Buffer fuctions is almost the same
> GM:S is using `js_read` `js_write`, Node.js is using `BM.read` `BM.write`
> 
```js
// Node.js
var read_buffer = BM.load(data);               // load buffer
var get_index1 = BM.read(read_buffer, BM.u8);  // buffer_read(read_buffer, buffer_u8);

var write_buffer = BM.create(1024);            // buffer_create(1024, buffer_grow, 1);
BM.write(write_buffer, BM.u8, get_index1);     // buffer_write(write_buffer, buffer_u8);
```

* Very easy to use

* Based Event
